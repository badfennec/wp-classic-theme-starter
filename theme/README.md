# BadFennec WP Starter Theme

A lightweight, "blank canvas" **Classic WordPress Starter Theme** designed for modern development workflows.

This is not a ready-to-use visual theme; it is a technical scaffold intended for developers who need total control over the markup and architecture. It does **not** support Full Site Editing (FSE), sticking to the reliable PHP-based classic structure.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Classic Architecture:** Traditional PHP structure (non-FSE), ideal for complex custom builds.
* **Modern Frontend Stack:**
    * **TailwindCSS:** For rapid, utility-first styling.
    * **Webpack:** Handles asset compilation, minification, and bundling.
    * **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** For a smooth development experience.
* **Professional PHP Management:**
    * **Composer:** Handles PHP dependencies and PSR-4 autoloading.
    * **Modular Code:** Logic is strictly separated from views.
* **WooCommerce Ready:** Pre-configured structure and directory support for WooCommerce template overrides.
* **Automated Assets:** Source files are compiled and automatically output to `theme/assets`.
